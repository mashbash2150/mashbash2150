### Hi, I'm Madeline!

I'm a developer, automation expert, design enthusiast, and explorer looking to join efforts to bridge gaps between art and science, creativity and logic, form and function. Amongst the hunt for undiscovered solutions to difficult problems is where I do my best work.  


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native, surveying the world of React UI libraries, and dabbling in Trim Carpentry
